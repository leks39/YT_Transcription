Transcribing YouTube Videos
Python is a versatile language that can be used for a variety of tasks, including transcription of Youtube videos. In a recent ad hoc task, I learned how to transcribe videos using Python in just five simple steps. 


To get started, you'll need to install the "youtube_transcript_api" library and obtain the URL of the video you want to transcribe. For my exercise, I selected a video from the Youtube channel of Jessica Stansberry titled "How to Transcribe Videos + Why You Should." 


The five steps are as follows: 

1. Import the newly installed youtube_transcript_api library

2. Define a function that takes a YouTube video URL as input and returns the transcription of the video

3. Include a try-except block in the return section to handle any errors in transcription

4. Save the video URL to be transcribed to a variable, then call the yt_video_transcriber function with the provided URL and store the result in another variable

5. Print the transcription


Learning how to transcribe YouTube videos can take less than 10 minutes, and you can also sneak in the use of functions described earlier in the week. Give it a try to see if it works!
